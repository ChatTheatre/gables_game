# Clothing components and details for Gables

Components and details for three different eras, male and female, skewed towards upper class evening wear.
Period names are: Victorian, Edwardian, and Contemporary. “Contemporary” denotes post 1920 business or evening clothing (not as complicated as Edwardian items). A few Ageless items, mostly men’s underwear, are also listed.

Some traits I may suggest:
* cleanliness: soiled, dirty, filthy, grubby, unpressed, unkempt, clean, neatly-pressed, starched 
* condition: rough, threadbare, worn, frayed, tattered, patched, moth-eaten, shabby, shoddy, torn, ripped, battered, ragged, pristine 
* weight: flimsy, sheer, diaphanous, gauzy, thin, sleek, thick, heavy 
* fit: loose, form-fitting, well-tailored, snug, tight 
* style: crude, dowdy, unstylish, old-fashioned, outdated, plain, old, fashionable, stylish, chic, dapper, smart, rakish, elegant 

Not all of the above terms can be applied to all types of clothing, of course. For men’s suits (not of tropical variety), some traits:
        •       fabric: broadcloth (wool), serge (serge, often blue or gray/grey), chevoit (wool), tweed (wool), worsted (wool), silk 
        •       casual or summer fabrics: flannel, corduroy (wool or cotton), duck (cotton), twill, whipcord (cotton), moleskin, 
        •       color: black, gray/grey, plaid, tan, brown, blue, herringbone, checked, windowpane check, khaki, pinstriped, drab 
For men’s dress shirts, typical traits are:
        •       fabric: silk, cotton, chambray (more of a work shirt material) 
        •       color: gray, white, blue, polkadot, green, tan, patterned 
For ties, they are either a bow tie or necktie.
        •       fabrics: silk, knit wool, rayon 
        •       color: red, maroon, purple, gray, blue, black, white, striped, patterned, polkadot
